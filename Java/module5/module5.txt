(Note: Some class names are used in many tests, so any .java files should be
recompliled before being run to ensure that the correct version of the class
is being used)

Exercise 5.1
see DynamicExample.java

Exercise 5.2


Exercise 5.3


Exercise 5.4


Exercise 5.5


Exercise 5.6


Exercise 5.7


Exercise 5.8


Exercise 5.9
You find that it prints out something to the effect of "ObjX@8dc8569" which
appears to be a pointer associated with ObjX. 

Exercise 5.10
part-I: see TestComplex.java

part-II: yes, it works to add static variables inside the the complex because
they are being used in a static context (static void main). They are
persisting variables in the respective ojects c1 and c2.

Exercise 5.11
see TestComplex.java

Exercise 5.12
Out is a static member the System class. In this case it is an instance of PrintSream which contains the method println.

The println() method is found in the PrintStream class. Its signature is
something like:

public void println () { }

Exercise 5.13
see TestComplex2.java

Exercise 5.14
1. When creating an instance of class C, the print statements from the super
classes A and B are also printed out. This is because the super() command is
executed implicitly.

2. No, static variables are not inherited. They are instead kept in whatever
class they are assigned to, not changed when changed in subclasses.
