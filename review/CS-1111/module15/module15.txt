Exercise 7
int a=0;
for(int i=0; i<1000; i++){
  if(i*i < 1000)
    a=i;
}
System.out.println(a*a);

Exercise 13

String digits = "";
for(int k=123456789; k>0; k = k/10){
  k = k%10;
  digits = k+digits;
}
System.out.println(digits);

Exercise 15
This doesn't work because the String is treated as and array and you can't have a negative numbered element in an array.

Exercise 16
Yes, since zero is a valid index, change position to zero will work.

Exercise 18
No, this will lead to an error because i will continue to increase until it is out of bounds of the array.
